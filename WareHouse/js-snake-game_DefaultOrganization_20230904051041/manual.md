The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

This user manual provides detailed instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and play the Snake Game in a web browser.
